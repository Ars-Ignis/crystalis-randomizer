Goal: make the boat and shell flute each useful on their own.
 - with randomized overworld, boat will go to a separate lake
   disconnected from the main ocean (though maybe it could have
   dolphin/flight-accessible locations as well?)
 - boat beach connected to some other land exit?

To make the boat appear somewhere else:
 - move the entrance (60:0)
 - move the spawn (slot 1b -> 4:3a)
 - optionally change the tiles to c9/d1 (not required)

Boat in Portoa:
 - spawn slot 0d -> 4:39
 - same location trigger 2:b0 - condition 021 => action 1f
 - behavior is the same: just move left and drag the player along with

Idea:
 - turn boat around (sprite)
    - could probably add a separate animation frame to same metasprite (c1)
    - just keep the animation frame constant... (remove `dec 4e0,x`)
 - generalize the direction, endpoint, and drop-off somehow.
   no good way to build it into spawn table, but we could use a table of
   locations to handle differently?
 - what to do about the boat being in two different spots? i.e. we need a
   spawn at the screen edge, but we also need one on beach
 - check player coordinate next to boat?
 - may need a second spawn, but be clever about despawning it?
 - spawn it at the edge, but on first frame check player location and if
   not entering screen then relocate to dock and flip direction.
 - consider adding a new location for this, rather than using the sea?
   will also need new map screens

Flags:
 - fisherman now always in boat house?
    - single fog lamp item gets access to other side of channel
 - dolphin now always spawns? -> extra check
    - single shell flute item gets access to sea
    - what about spawning hurt dolphin?  probably don't
    - so the dolphin in the cave is just a check
