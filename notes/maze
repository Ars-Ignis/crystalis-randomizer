Maze shuffle is hard

Problem: Crypt hall 1 (and styx 1) are failing

Mainly related (at this point) to the size and the lack of
options in the wide tileset.  Easy fix is to simply add the
missing screens, but without that we need to be smarter
about how we do initial fill - i.e. avoid |- and -| style
branches and horizontal dead ends.  It might also be possible
to trim problematic dead ends and branches?
