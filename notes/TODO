1. Add crumbling horizontal platform, shuffle crumbling platforms.
2. Gas mask -> hazmat suit

================

Graphics
 - for each pattern table, list out available metasprites/metatiles
 - palettes, too?

====

Option: add key items to extra locations
  - specifically, (1) stoned pair, ??
Option: remove alarm flute from shops
  - works nicely with previous, though we'd need to also move it to other row to prevent dropping
  - i.e. new key item, new slots for them.
  - would want more of an "any road" to avoid needing the windmill right off?
  - could add an item from student and start with zero cash
NOTE: one important routing difficulty is that we need to ensure that
      these options *don't* render the game in an unwinnable state
       - e.g. need to traverse all combinations of flute usage
              and ensure in all combinations that either both flutes can
              be used or no flute can be.
      we don't want to fix this by requiring both flutes, since this would
      ruin the vanilla route
  - could we add a simple "blocks" check?
    if USING the first flute is a BLOCKER on the second flute then we're good
    but we currently don't have a concept of "require to be blocked on"

Speed up the whole thing:
 - The only thing we're changing is the mapping from slot to item.
 - Each slot has a bunch of antecedants, which can be expressed in ksat
   terms: (a and b and c) or (a and d and e) or (b and f)
 - precompute the full antecedants for each slot in terms of only items.
   now we can easily evaluate many more questions and faster
   - multiple flute questions -> will picking the wrong target break me?

Only a problem
     IF Flute 2's shuffled slot is blocked on Statue 1's item
     AND Statue 2's blockers (aside from Flute 2) are NOT.

Example (When printing graph with ORs, just connect the one that was satisfied)

  Slot(Sword of Wind) <- ()
  Slot(Windmill Key) <- ()
  Slot(Refresh) <- (Windmill Key)
  Slot(Ball of Wind) <- (Windmill Key)
  Slot(Rabbit Boots) <- (Sword of Wind AND Ball of Wind) # elide transitive dep
  Slot(Statue of Onyx) <- (Sword of Wind AND Ball of Wind)
  Slot(Gas Mask) <- (Statue of Onyx)

When integrating, build up entire traversal from start
 - each node gets a full set -> persistent sets would help here?
 - when we see
 
     Slot(c) <- (a AND b)
     Slot(d) <- (a AND b AND c)

   rewrite it as

     Slot(d) <- (c)

   For each element, if any of its full-deps are present, remove them.
   Use immutablejs for this to get efficient persistent sets?

Other identities:

  (a AND b) OR (a AND b AND c) -> (a AND b)
  If any depset is a subset of any other, remove the larger one.

But wait - this won't work if the slots change!  E.g. if Statue of Onyx moved
to Valley of Wind then we'd still need Sword and Ball of Wind to even get to
Akahana to cash in on it.  So we need to keep all the requirements, no
substituting.  For any given graph we can SIMPLIFY it like that, but then it's
no longer suitable for shuffling.

 - still need to save oak kid?

 - mimic pattern table?
   weird insect in 66cd894/#seed=c900e24b - fog lamp cave
 - crc
 - hell mode

=====

map connections - $c2 in desert is a nice new cave screen
 - could connect up to swamp?
    --> definitely need to tell folks *something* about route
   - connect swamp to sahara?
     -> flight required for anything useful...
        but could remove that, too?
