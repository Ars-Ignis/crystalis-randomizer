Damage calculations
 - figure out how to scale
 - current plan - have tables for HP, atk, def at each difficulty level
 - each monster's data has a multiplier (0 .. 2 ?  .5 .. 1.5 ?) and adder (-8 .. 7)
 - TODO - figure out if there's any attribute always set on monsters and use that to trigger


SetPlayer340Lower
 - what is this actually doing?


crap... lost the buffer positions!


Text - how is the message ID populated?
Triggers - still not clear on how other NPC types work
         - people and bosses...?


Graphics
 - for each pattern table, list out available metasprites/metatiles
 - palettes, too?




Prototype
 - code up damage scalaing, then randomize just enemies - try to play, see how it goes?
   - will need to pay attention to vulnerabilities...
 - next can try randomizing items.
