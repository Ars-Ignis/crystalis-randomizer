Damage calculations
 - figure out how to scale
 - current plan - have tables for HP, atk, def at each difficulty level
 - each monster's data has a multiplier (0 .. 2 ?  .5 .. 1.5 ?) and adder (-8 .. 7)
 - TODO - figure out if there's any attribute always set on monsters and use that to trigger


SetPlayer340Lower
 - what is this actually doing?


crap... lost the buffer positions!


Text - how is the message ID populated?
Triggers - still not clear on how other NPC types work
         - people and bosses...?


Graphics
 - for each pattern table, list out available metasprites/metatiles
 - palettes, too?




Prototype
 - code up damage scalaing, then randomize just enemies - try to play, see how it goes?
   - will need to pay attention to vulnerabilities...
 - next can try randomizing items.


====

shuffle a list of map changes, as manual functions
 - would need to operate on both the depgraph and the rom
 - e.g. sealed cave dumps out on portoa, close up other exit entirely
        extra swamp exit
        extra amazones exit, etc
        go right from start to get to desert 1?
   possibly shuffle these into normal swaps, too?
manually swap swords of wind and fire - could maybe do this before depgraph?
 - no rabbit boots -> no tornado bracelet ?
add bracelets to shuffle (may need to change teleport trigger tho, or just remove)
