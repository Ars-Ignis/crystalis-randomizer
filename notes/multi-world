Goal: Multi-world co-op randomization

Main problems:
 * Need an extra layer of indirection for itemgets
 * Need to distinguish flags for checks vs items

Basic idea:
 * Carve out an area of PRG RAM for incoming and outgoing items.
 * Outgoing items can be a pair of bytes: player #, item #.
   - could have a queue in case of slow connection?
 * Incoming items probable should be a single slot: 6 bytes
   for who it came from, 1 for item #.
 * Whenever sending or receiving an item, automatically checkpoint.
   (or else server needs to keep track and re-give? sequence number
   could do that)
 * If auto-checkpoint, then probably can't receive items while
   screen is locked (esp. e.g. insect or draygon 2).
 * Itemgets need two bytes: item and player who gets it.
 * Need separate flag for
     (1) don't respawn chest/boss, and
     (2) got capability (teleport, telepathy, etc).
   Currently we conflate these, but at least for (2) we'd need to
   go back to using e.g. 01a for telepathy, rather than 243, and
   we need to be careful what the itemget data table contains.

RAM Area:
 * There are several unused areas of PRG RAM that we could use.
    - 6160 .. 61ff
    - 6220 .. 62ef
 * What do we need to store?
    - Each player's name: 6*n bytes
        - Probably set a max of 16 players, so this is $60 bytes.
          If we use the smaller space at 6160 that takes us to 61c0.
    - Outgoing items: two bytes each (who it goes to, which item).
    - Incoming items: two bytes each (who it came from, which item).
 * How big of a buffer do we need?
    - The lua should be able to pick up outgoing items immediately
      and should buffer incoming items?  Need to test this.
    - That means we only need a single slot: 61c0 .. 61c3

================================================================

Code considerations:

ItemGet (1c26f) needs an extra preamble.  Currently it's a big mess.
It takes $23 as an argument and *immediately* looks it up in both
the ItemGetTable and the ItemGetDataTable.  The ItemGetDataTable
stores flags and follow-up actions, etc.  The flags are used for
very different purposes:

 * Telepathy (00e) is used for dialog checks
 * Teleport (03f) is used for teleport trigger

 * Flame Bracelet (102) is used for kelbesque's spawn
 * Key to Stxy (03b) is used for massacre trigger

The former need to go with the item, the latter with the check.
We should consolidate ALL of these into a single block...?
Some items don't have any flags in their ItemGet (i.e. ones that
come from NPCs in certain non-repeatable conditions, like Gas Mask
and Shield Ring).  We add 2xx flags that travel with the item, but
also use it for the chest spawn, which is unfortunate.  An extra
block of flags could be helpful here.

Here are the flags for all items:

================================================================

We should be able to simplify slots quite a bit.
 - but still may need the indirection table for > 48?? (but could be shorter)
 - lua needs to be able to determine if (say) the Nth herb is still gotten
 - then we need both flag tables to go up to 6f...?
