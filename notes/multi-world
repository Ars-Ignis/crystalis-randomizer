Goal: Multi-world co-op randomization

Main problems:
 * Need an extra layer of indirection for itemgets
 * Need to distinguish flags for checks vs items

Basic idea:
 * Carve out an area of PRG RAM for incoming and outgoing items.
 * Outgoing items can be a pair of bytes: player #, item #.
   - could have a queue in case of slow connection?
 * Incoming items probable should be a single slot: 6 bytes
   for who it came from, 1 for item #.
 * Whenever sending or receiving an item, automatically checkpoint.
   (or else server needs to keep track and re-give? sequence number
   could do that)
 * If auto-checkpoint, then probably can't receive items while
   screen is locked (esp. e.g. insect or draygon 2).
 * Itemgets need two bytes: item and player who gets it.
 * Need separate flag for
     (1) don't respawn chest/boss, and
     (2) got capability (teleport, telepathy, etc).
   Currently we conflate these, but at least for (2) we'd need to
   go back to using e.g. 01a for telepathy, rather than 243, and
   we need to be careful what the itemget data table contains.
