Goal: Shyron massacre does not require Sword of Thunder to trigger it.

Reason: It's somewhat artificial, and blocks Mado 1 from ever holding it.

Problem: It's a bad experience to open a chest and warp immediately into
a boss fight.  By requiring SoT for massacre, that can never happen.  It
might also be possible to have a different sword trigger the warp.

We can get around this by instead warping to right outside the temple:
 - Change $3d5c9 to set 6c/6d to 8c/41 instead of f2/41.

We will probably need to add something in pass/deterministic.ts to
remove the flag (though we probably already added something somewhere
to tweak it to a different version?)

Will definitely need to update overlay.ts to understand that SoT
teleports to a different location.

We *may* need to update overlay.ts to not use the requirement (though that
might come for free), or any other custom logic that assumes it's required.

Possible side effect: overworld shuffle
 - Will Shyron temple be separable from Shyron itself?  It would be nice
   if it were, but it's not clear that that's tenable.  Because Zebu is
   a requirement for the massacre, it's guaranteed you know where the
   temple *is* before you can trigger it, but it's less clear whether you
   need to have been to Shyron - it seems like that would not be
   unreasonable...?
