so yeah in AP you can use the generate_output step and just call your patcher and you'll have full access to all the data for the seed

https://github.com/PiotrDabkowski/Js2Py

secret of evermore is python wrapped around C
i think it only writes in the locations where if it doesn't put an item there everything breaks
the rest it leaves as an empty "AP item" and if its their own item they just receive it from the server like any other item
you cant have unfilled locations

it's very possible you'll have spots you'll need to fill before generation. anything done before or in generate_basic is before the actual fill step
the actual kind of "do this in this step" hasn't really been formalized yet but there's plenty of examples
it is, read api.md
i'd definitely recommend referencing both SoE and TS for your world though
api.md just kind of covers what the different steps do but you don't really have to use them though probably should

there's steps to help with stuff such as map generation but you should probably do that in generate_early so if you need to crash it's quick
the item shuffle would be done by AP anyway, so only your special stuff really matters
that's ok, but you should retry early
as in realize no sphere 1 is reachable and retry; before AP goes into item placement
because AP does that step once only
and expects it to work then
one idea would be to quickly verify with a single-world item placement
yeah that has to be done before AP starts its filling
you can make a state object with no items and check accessible locations
you can just get reachable locations through AP and see if its 0
since you need to encode it for AP anyway
this will also allow you to check if there's a small number (<5 or such) available checks and force an early item

Serializing ROM object
 - could use JSON or protobuf
 - move expanded PRG to start
 - output actual patch (could auto-apply in UI)
 - add a hash as well for optional checksum
 - find-replace ($|0x)3[cdef]\x{3} with 3->7

Client
 - knowing which parts of memory are important to check

======

Dealing with the ROM input issue:
 - a two-pass shuffle would allow minimizing the data in
   the serialized Rom object.
What is the required input/output of a pre-shuffle?
Inputs:
 - Imported labels that must be provided elsewhere
Outputs:
 - (serialized) Rom
   - possibly just map of extracted data tables
 - Map of exported labels to address
 - Map of where the imported labels show up
 - The patched ROM itself, obvi

This will prevent optimizing the free space, but we could
potentially be very efficient about defragging early on?
If there's only a single large chunk of free space in each
block then we can dispense with the fancy linker and just
write stupidly.
