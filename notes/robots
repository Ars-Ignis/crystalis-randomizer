# Problem: White robots spawn out of nowhere outside tower.

1b:b5f3 is the action script 5e, initially set on white robots.
Once per 64 frames, it checks if all the brown robots are gone
and if so, it spawns the white robot by changing action script
to #$2a and hitbox/collision plane to #$10.

Solution: Patch 5e action script to immediately transform to
a white robot if we're _not_ in the tower.


# Bug: Despawning upper levels of tower skips the fight.

This is probably due to moving the seamless exits by a tile
so that the actionscript 5e requirement of the brown robot
being on the same level fails.  I don't know why this causes
the escalator to appear (cf. $1b:a440) - that seems to be
governed by a watcher (4-spawn da, actionscript 5f).

Upon further inspection, we seem to have _lost_ the down
exits, which is also breaking the door back to crypt.  When
we go down a screen, it screws up all the y_scr-based checks.


# Goal: Shuffle different enemies into the tower.

This is difficult since the ID (50) is hardcoded into the
check and the dormancy is hardcoded into the action script.
To support something different, we'd likely want to change
things around a little by repurposing action 5e to instead
be a "watcher", which would start by "hiding" all the
monsters in the doorway slots (back up their actionscript
and maybe other data, then set their actionscripts to 5e in
a way that would not break), then would subsequently check
if the brown robot slots (non-flyer slots?) were killed;
if so, it would restore the backed-up data for the white
robot replacements.

NOTE: the watcher actually already exists (4-spawn $da with
actionscript 5f).  We should just use that instead.

NOTE: the screen reachability calculation in metalocation.of
is incorrect for the tower's seamless exits - it seems to mark
a neighboring floor as also reachable, which might lead to
bad enemy placement?


# Goal: full tower mobility

Problem: When leaving Mesia's room, the down escalator disappears.
This is because we don't do the normal escalator setup on entering
that room.  We need to instead move the special case (1b:a4a0) to
_after_ the normal setup (1b:a4b2).

NOTE: Simply running the normal setup after the special case is
glitchy, since it does two OAMDMA waits.
