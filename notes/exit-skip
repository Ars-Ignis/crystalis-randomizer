Unusable item - buffer A-B while holding 'up'.
Telepathy works too
 - triggers, slopes, and exits all not checked

FindExit @ 3eb09

ItemUseError @ 3d526
 - sets game mode to status msg.

Fix should be similar to trigger skip, but needs to be a little more general.
 - consider setting a bit somewhere else?

Probably best is to just *not* move on the first frame after a message is
displayed (including telepathy or other menus).
 - set a latch somewhere and then reset it at 35ec2 instead of calling MoveObject.
 - ShowMessage will handle some of them, check game mode for telepathy

This might also have some effect on statue glitch...?
Possibly anything that looks up any text at all?

Setting it in LookupMessageInternal is broken because you can't buffer
the opposite direction while talking to statues... we can instead set
the latch in ItemUse, TelepathyUse, etc - maybe the game modes?
 - check the latch at the very beginning of object action jump 03
