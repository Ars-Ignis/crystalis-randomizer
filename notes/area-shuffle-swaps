# Using swaps for area shuffle

One issue: sphere-0 checks.

To ensure there are any at all, we may want to move the zebu student item
to the startled villager instead.

Minor issue: sealed cave.

If possible, we should try to seal the cave on the other side of wind
valley, whatever it is?  But it's possible it's a terminal cave, or not
simple, etc...?
 - could take a closer look at it in more detail?
