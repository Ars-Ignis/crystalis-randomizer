Initializing the game happens very differently depending on whether the game
is started normally vs continued.

When starting normally, MainLoopJump_00_PrepareGame (fe:c957) manually loads
all the values where they need to go.

When continuing from a corrupted file (such as an initialized quicksave) it
simply copies data from a table at 2fe00.  For instance, 2fe84 has the $1e
(decimal 30) that ends up at 706 for next-level exp, followed by the $22
(dec 34) that ends up at 708 and 709 for cur/max MP.
