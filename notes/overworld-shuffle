Goal: rebuild connections between areas to be totally different.

Basic approach:
 - build a graph connecting all major overworld areas
   (non-overworld areas have significantly lower coordination)
 - remove edges until there are no cycles
 - add back 2-3 extra edges randomly (including on top of existing ones)
    - require that (waterfall valley / angry sea) is arterial?
    - maybe not...
 - add appropriate connectors between overworld spots, getting correct tyoes
 - branching connectors will always branch to a terminal (possibly via some
   number of connectors), never to a third area?? (east cave??)
    - doing so would make a connector into an artery, which we don't want!?
