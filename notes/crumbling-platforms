Goal: Randomize whether any given platform will crumble after you exit.

Background:
Currently there are three platform objects: 7e, 7f, and 9f.  7e is the normal
vertical platform, 7f i the normal horizontal platform, and 9f is the crumbling
vertical platform that only ever shows up in the crypt.  The platform direction
is controlled by $360,x.

Plan:
Find a free object ID (e.g. 8d is nearby) and copy 9f into 8d, but switch $360,x
to be 2 instead of 0.  Then in a randomized pass, randomize which is used:
 - change random 7e to 9f and vice versa
 - change random 7f to 8d
