Plan for deploying versions:

Branches:
 - "stable"
 - "master"
 - etc

Tags:
 - 1.0.0
 - 1.0.1 ...

Structure:

  index.html => stable/index.html
  track.html => stable/track.html
  js => stable/js
  css => stable/css
  stable => 1.0.1

  1.0.1/
    index.html
    track.html
    js/...
    css/...

  rc/
    index.html
    ...    

  latest/
    ...



When there is a release candidate (i.e. 'rc' branch
is different from 'stable'), root points to /rc,
which has a banner at the top:

  NOTE: this is a release candidate.  For the stable
  version, please visit /stable.
