Better compression to get more space for maps?

 - switch ext to be a page number (5-6 bits), then all we need is (aligned) blocks
   of 240 bytes to move one-off maps to
   --> could still use 2 bits for compressed animation (~100 bytes saved?)
 - remove 5th dialog byte - should give us back several hundred bytes?
 - consolidate all the change dialogs w/ just "do i know you?"
   --> 390 bytes from dialog table, 100-200 maybe from messages?
 - write message blocks into separate individual arrays, then place opportunistically
   and update banks as needed (again, we can reuse arbitrary banks here)
   --> see how much space we already save in our recompression?
 - gut fluff dialog

Ideally we could find ~2k for new maps, maybe?

We could replace all shops with 100 (inn - stairs) to get 512 back easily enough
