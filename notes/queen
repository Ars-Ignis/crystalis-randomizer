# Disentangle the queen's logic

The queen's logic is very complicated since it depends so much on state,
and is entangled with so much:
 - sword of water
 - rage/mesia
 - fortune teller
 - two guards: a mover and a statue

To accommodate this, we've made a number of guarantees:
 - Asina in the back room will give the Flute of Lime, which is required
   in case Rage is in logic before the queen.
 - Mesia is the trigger instead of Rage, which ensures that when the queen
   disappears to the back room, we don't soft lock from not being able to
   get back there to get the first item.
 - We also added a land bridge to ensure that we don't soft-lock by getting
   off the dolphin in the wrong spot and going through a door, and also to
   ensure the logic doesn't require summoning the dolphin from that beach.

For the dolphin soft-lock, simply removing dolphin access from those tiles
seems sufficient, and we need to do that independently from the land bridge
since otherwise logic could expect dolphin to replace sword/ball of water
or flight to cross over to the back room.  And since wild warp is now easy,
the soft lock is further prevented (assuming anyone reads the documentation).

For Sword of Water, we should just remove that check, since it's not natural.
Sword of Water should not obviate the need to do the paralysis dance.

We can move the back-room requirement back to Rage if we give the Flute of
Lime to the guard, or leave it on the throne, or something along those lines.
This would allow separating Mesia from Rage in entrance shuffle, leaving only
the palace front and throne room attached at the hip (and of course, reworking
whatever trigger squares outside the palace cause movement).

We also need to verify that the fortune teller room can be cleared by talking
to her from the back, leaving, and re-entering.



# Additional notes

First dialog:
 - set 09c, 019, 01a
 - 019 and 09c cleared upon leaving palace
 - 020 set => should be in fortune teller's room
