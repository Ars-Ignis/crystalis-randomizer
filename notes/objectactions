Basic routines:

Random Movement
  $380:80 set
    only update every 8 frames when off screen
  $480
    seems to be reset to some small number (20s or 30s) and
    controls how far the random step will be, though sometimes we stop in
    the middle (e.g. $2c).  Monster always stops moving when it his zero, then
    resetsit again. (unlike $4e0 that's never reset).  This alternates with
    $600 in ticking it down.
  $4a0
    animation countdown timer, one tick per frame
  $600
    wait time to move - alternates with $480 - one or other ticks each frame
  Calls GenerateRandomNumber to determine which direction
  Immediately picks a new direction (with a delay and random step length)
  on bump

Homing Movement
  $380:80 set
    only update every 8 frames when off screen
  $380:08 clear
    update $300 with new metasprite ID on each direction change
  $480
    timer to change directions every 16 frames
  $4a0
    animation countdown timer, two ticks per frame
  $600
    random swerve direction, initialized on a bump to 0 or 1 based
    on the global counter; every four frames while swerving we try
    turning; this is the first direction we try, but if it's blocked,
    we turn the other way.
  $620
    swerve timer, counts frames to spin around in different directions
    to avoid obstacles; set to #$60 on bump
  $6c0
    metasprite base for directions (for directional sprites)
    when turning, $300 <- $6c0 | ($360 >> 1)

Shoot
  $440
    ad-hoc spawn index of shot
  $640
    whether to shoot
    set to $1f before double-return in $37714, provided everything is
    aligned (on screen, roughly once every 4 seconds)
    when this is nonzero, we prepare to shoot instead of moving

$20 Random Movement
  Slimes $50 $53, Jellies $52 $6b, Living rocks $61 $66, Spider $62
  Crab $6d, Jellyfish $76, Scorpion $96


$21 Stone Gazer : Random Movement, Shoot
  Medusa $6c, Giant Eyes $85 $94

  $660
    seems to never actually be reset, just decremented so that
    it can do nothing every other frame while preparing to shoot    


$22 Buried Monster
  Ice zombie $60, Sand monster $79

  $4e0
    timer to "wake up"
  $6a0
    replacement object action (-> $480 after timer)
  $6c0
    replacement sprite (-> $300 after timer)
    note that for a homing (or subclass) follow-on this may be reused
    as the directional base


$24 Homing Movement
  Weretiger $51, Wyverns $56 $63, Large slimes $5f (blue), Earth entity $72


$25 Mushroom Movement : Homing Movement
  Mushrooms $5a $71, Ice entity $65

  Also includes buried monsters Ice zombie $60 and Sand monster $79
  Same as weretiger, only diff is that it doesn't chase when off screen

$26 Orc Move Or Throw : Homing Movement, Shoot
  Orc $58, Dark green wyvern $78, Shadows $7b $8c

  Main difference from normal homing movement + shoot is that it adds
  a new directional metasprite base to use when the ammunition is loaded
  or just released.
  $320
    when moving (not throwing) this gets bits :1c cleared (& #$03).
    not clear who previously wrote, or who reads, this - it was
    probably a mistake and should have been some other address?
  $6e0
    metasprite base when directional and shooting


$27 Troll Move Or Throw : $26 Orc Move Or Throw
  Troll $6a, Red spider $74, Fishman $75, Salamander $86,
  Tarantula $91, Mummy $99, Tomb guardian $9a
            TODO - what are fishman and tomb guardian?

  Main difference from $26 is that off-screen objects stop moving entirely


$28 Golem Move Or Throw : Homing Movement, Shoot
  Rock golem $54, Ice golem $67

  This ticks down 4e0 to zero before incrementing 660 allowing
  it to move at all.  Seems kind of silly.

  Hard-codes metasprite IDs #$65 and #$91 (when shooting)
             => requires [60,6c] for pattern banks always
  Diagonal shots allowed

  $660
    initial timer before any moves happen (why?)


$29 Amorphous Blob : Homing Motion, Shoot
  Lavaman $82, Sandman $98

  Changes planes from 1 to 4 when sunken (sword is 3, so can't hit 4)
  Also changes hardcoded metasprite IDs

  $620
    swerving
    when swerving, zero out the collision planes (upper nibble 3a0).
  $640
    shooting
    

$2a Solider : Homing Motion, Shoot 2
  Soldiers $64 $89, Archer $80, Ground Sentry $a0 (kind of like an archer)

  Custom shoot routine (does not delegate to CheckToShootProjectile)
  Still uses $440 and $640 the same, though $640 runs from $f to $0 and
  fires on $8.

  $6e0
    alternate base metasprite for shooting frames

$2b Mimic : ??
  Mimic $73

$2e Flail Knights
  Lizardman $84, Black Knight $95

  First time through for any given knight, 6a0 is zero.
  In this case, we spawn a child and zero out 440 to
  prevent the soldier script from spawning any more
  When it successfully spawns, we write its $6a0 to
  point to the parent object's index.

  $5a0
    (referenced via flail's action script)
  
  $6a0
    when nonzero, just do soldier action

  $380:10
    removed at start of action ... ?

  $440
    projectile spawn if nonzero, shot randomly on average once a second

  $560
    summoned insect ($c4) sets to 1 to indicate it needs to despawn
    as soon as the giant insect is killed ($4ad positive, presumably
    it's replaced by an explosion or something).

  $600
    incremented each frame no turn, decremented each frame turned
    used as key to data table and then stored back to $600.
    (actually it looks like +2 on straight and +0 on turn)
    then look up another data table with new $600 to get $340
    (knockback/speed)
    TODO - haven't really figured this one out

  TODO - adapt this? do we hold back the masses first? spawn them
         once the first 3 are killed?  i don't see why...
         store the object id to spawn in some position???
