# Website Cleanup

Basic idea: delete old versions that don't matter. Also maybe reset git history.

Keep numbered versions, active branches, recent rc's, and permalinks from
the last few months.

1.  Back up entire repo to a zip file, burn or upload to Google Drive.
2.  Delete old branches
    ```sh
    rm -rf 1.*-rc* foo bar baz
    ```
3.  Collect all the sha we need to keep
    ```sh
    for a in */js/build_info.js; do
      grep HASH sha/files |
          sed "s/.*: '//" |
          head -c 7
      echo
    done | sort -u > /tmp/keep1
    ```
    Also look at manifest (find a good cutoff)
    ```sh
    tail -33 sha/files/manifest | cut -f1 -d' ' > /tmp/keep2
    # ...
    cat /tmp/keep[12] | sort -u > /tmp/keep
    egrep "$(paste -sd '|' /tmp/keep)" sha/files/manifest > /tmp/manifest
    mv /tmp/manifest sha/files/manifest
    ```
4.  Prune the unnecessary sha
    ```sh
    for a in sha/???????; do
      if ! grep -q files /tmp/keep; then
        rm -rf $a
      fi
    done
    ```
5.  Garbage-collect the sha/files
    ```sh
    find sha/??????? -type l -exec readlink {} \; |
        sed 's,.*/files/,,' | sort -u > /tmp/keep-files
    for a in sha/files/*/*; do
      if ! grep -q ${a#sha/files/} /tmp/keep-files; then
        echo rm $a
      else
        echo "# keep $a"
      fi
    done
    ```
