mimic%
======

Two new flags:
 1. mimic% - all mimics required for draygon2
    - mimics only spawn once
 2. mimics can hold items

Basic idea:
 - new slot logic, we have an extra BIT in the itemget ID.
   - 80 means mimic
   - reroute the mimic spawn through the first layer of itemget
   - store the check ID in the mimic, check it again in the death action
   - leve behind an object that can be gotten to set flags, get item
 - items 70..7f could be repurposed as stacks of cash?

Question:
 - how do we shuffle mimics?  where do we make the swap?
   - the spawn?
     - will mess up naming, maybe other things.
   - the spawn/check-to-itemget mapping?
     --> this seems like the right answer
   - the itemget-to-item mapping?
     - itemget-to-item will be abbreviated so that's no good
