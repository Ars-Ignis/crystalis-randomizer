Warping to zombie town:

The warp code all starts around 3dc58, which is the table with warp locations.
It conveniently has an empty slot at the end that we could use, but the main
difficulty is that the flags it checks are offset so that Sahara (entry $0a)
is at flag 2ff, the last one that's actually saved.  We would need to move the
flags to start at 2f4 instead of 2f5.

Here are things we'd need to adjust to add a new town warp:
 * add the town to the TownWarpTable (3dc58) - we probably want to put it
   somewhere in the middle, rather than at the end
 * if the order changes then we need to reformat the message (21:00)
 * we also need to change the flag references:
    - warp setpoint triggers
    - oak (2f7): set by two triggers (8e and aa - is aa unneeded?)
    - oak (2f7): checked by tornel spawn @1e, stom dialog @1e, trigger 85
    - joel (2fb): checked by kensu 68 spawn @61, trigger 8a (ESI)
 * the offset $05 is added explicitly (3dd59) -> change to #$04
 * the loop to build the menu starts at #$0a (3dd40) -> change to #$0b
 * there's a check that $22 is not #$0b (3dc7b) -> remove this check
