Treasure chest contents:
 - written at 1f860
reads from a data table, for vamp 1 that's 1f987
 (root stored in $18, y=4)
 1f96b is pointer table

entry point 1f807, from jump table 3cd28

NOTE:
 - flags to track the boss's defeat are tied to opening the chests!
 - so if we change their items then we need to move those flags to the new chests...
   alternatively, keep the same chest but change the contents???
   - this will cause the wrong message, tho?


What about chest spawns - ?
 - if we move the whole chest, that should be fine.
 - but then we shouldn't change the trigger...
 - but dialog gifts are a different story
   - depends on whether ItemGet or Dialog sets the flag.

flag 101 for defeating insect is in wrong position...
 ---> probably better off changing the spawn flag
 - could also just swap them in an earlier patch to ensure they're compatible.

some flags are set in common between dialog and itemget (e.g. sword of fire: 049)
 --> will be a problem to move...
 - could change one of them?
 - but if we moved to an unused chest, then nothing will gate on it?
 - hard to change dialog one because we may move it, so unclear where it will be...

in general, moving non-chests to chests is tricky, since there's no chest to move...
 - each item has a unique flag - easy to find.
need to find chest spawn conditions...?

prerequisite items, e.g. 017 sword of water
 - tied to item or chest? seems like we want to tie to item

NEEDS (NEW) FLAGS:
 - insect flute
 - oak elder
 - talk to deo
 - azteca - remove 079 from dialog
 - 2b warrior ring
 - broken statue (013 set on chest, but also spawns boss (npc 84) - maybe okay)
 - shell flute 08b - also triggers fisherman spawn (OK)
   - but be careful of item from healing dolphin
   - do we want to make healing the dolphin a requirement for USING the shell flute???
   - do we want to spawn the hurt dolphin on the swan beach as well???
 - gas mask and shield ring
   - currently share memory, need separate chunks with a flag
 - 32 windmill key, 34 key to styx, 37 eye glasses
   39 glowing lamp, 3a statue of gold, 3e bow of moon
   - no chest flags for any of these! will need to add.

 - barrier, flight, recover - no flags of their own
   - for barrier, the trigger has a flag (051), but not the spell...

 - if a chest item moves to not a chest then we could repurpose that flag...?
