Map alternatives:

Different tilesets have different alternatives, given by $13e00...$13f7f
 - most do nothing

Need to take an inventory of these
 - given each location, which metatiles does it use in which way
 - see if there are any free metatiles in any given tileset?
 - look into consolidating, rearranging?

No way to break down cave wall currently on ice bridge map.
01 and 02 intersected between the two
 - could use $11 and map to 00 ?
