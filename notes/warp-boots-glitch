Let's fix the warp boots reuse glitch.
Easiest way is probably to eliminate the extra checkpoints.

2fc00 is the most common entrance into the checkpoint code
2fc28 only runs once it's actually going to set it

on walking into a new map, ony hit 2fc28 once
 only call is from 3e503
  - game mode is 1

on teleport, 2fc28 runs twice:
 first call from 3e538
  - game mode is 14
 second call from 3e503
  - game mode still 14 

on a warp, 2fc28 runs three times!
 first call from 3e538 (ExitTypeJump_2_Warp)
  - location set, coords not
  - game mode is 6
 second call from 3e503 (ExitTypeJump_0_Normal)
  - coords fixed
  - boots still haven't been used up yet!
  - game mode is still 6
 third call from 3d4ef ("Teleported" follow-up of GameMode 06)
  - item finally consumed
  - game mode is 8

Probably we should just not set a checkpoint if game mode is 6?
