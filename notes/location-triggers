Would be nice to run triggers on location load rather than tile.

LoadNpcDataForLocation run at various times
SetCarryIfCheckpoint (2fdf6) reads table at 2ff00
 - could maybe compress table from 256 bytes to ~80 listing
   locations (iterating should be fine, and all save locations
   are also checkpoints, so we just start iterating earlier)

just execute trigger?

we could also compress 2fe00 w/ RLE
 - maybe pick a missing value to trigger a run?
 - 137 bytes instead of 255?
but... read from 3 different places...?

  lda #$00
  sta $61
  sta $63
  lda #$6d
  sta $62
  lda #$7d
  sta $72
  
 --> not feasible?  too complicated and don't want to repeat the RLE 3x

TriggerSquare (1c0e3, 16k page 07:1c..1f)
 - store ID into $23, then run

Should be able to run right away instead of spawning some triggers?
 - CheckForNpcSpawn 3e19d seems to be doing something
    - where is the timer-spawn check???  can we repurpose that flag for triggers?
    - maybe not - it bails out before getting to TryNpcSpawn
    - instead repurpose higher bits on type byte $2e


NpcData_LoadTrigger:  ; 3e3b8
  lda $2e
  bmi +
   lda #$0e
   jmp $3e2a8  ; consolidate with NpcDataJump_3
+ jmp ExecuteTriggerNow
; 3 bytes to spare...?


; 12 bytes - where to find them?
; we could put all of NpcData_LoadTrigger in bank 7?
ExecuteTriggerNow:
  lda $2f
  sta $23
  lda #$07
  jsr BankSwitch16k  ; $c40e
  jmp TriggerSquare  ; $80e3


There are 4 triggers with the timed bit set:
  10 Zebu Cave - 8c: leaf abduction (if not abducted and talked to zebu)
  a1 Tower 2 - 5a: tower message 1 (one-time)
  a2 Tower 3 - 5b: tower message 2 (one-time)
  c1 Swan Tavern - ef: enter tavern (set kensu gone if found kensu in tavern)

Only c1:ef makes sense to have as an area trigger...
Other area triggers we might want to consider:
 - roll-up flags for generals?
 - start game

We could possibly remove these triggers from the spawn slot counter, since
it will always be empty.  We could also add a new section of location triggers
that fire on every location change?

=======

NOTE: The above approach causes problems.  Specifically, switching the banks
in the middle of NPC loading seems to cause issues, and simply restoring them
doesn't seem to be enough.  We should consider an alternative approach, such
as repurposing something else in the NpcData table?  This could allow deleting
a handful of no-longer-necessary spawns, and could even save a good deal of
space.  We should also delete (or repurpose) the useless 0's at the front of
the table.  A simple byte indicating which 2xx flag should be set on entry
would get the job done...
