Would be nice to run triggers on location load rather than tile.

LoadNpcDataForLocation run at various times
SetCarryIfCheckpoint (2fdf6) reads table at 2ff00
 - could maybe compress table from 256 bytes to ~80 listing
   locations (iterating should be fine, and all save locations
   are also checkpoints, so we just start iterating earlier)

just execute trigger?

we could also compress 2fe00 w/ RLE
 - maybe pick a missing value to trigger a run?
 - 137 bytes instead of 255?
but... read from 3 different places...?

  lda #$00
  sta $61
  sta $63
  lda #$6d
  sta $62
  lda #$7d
  sta $72
  
 --> not feasible?  too complicated and don't want to repeat the RLE 3x

TriggerSquare (1c0e3, 16k page 07:1c..1f)
 - store ID into $23, then run

Should be able to run right away instead of spawning some triggers?
 - CheckForNpcSpawn 3e19d seems to be doing something
    - where is the timer-spawn check???  can we repurpose that flag for triggers?
