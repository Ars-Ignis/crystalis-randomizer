Paralysis Flags:
================
3504f has 9 flags that are used to track paralysis.  7 of them are never read
but will be written whenever the given NPC exists.  We need to clear these to
repurpose those flags.  In particular, just defrag the table to only have two
elements (or just hardcode it outside the table).

.org $35011
   lda #$03
   clc
   adc $13
   lsr
   cmp #$38
    bne >rts
+  lda #$01
   adc #$00 ; cs => 2, cc => 1
   bit $12
   beq +
    ora $648e
    bne ++ ; uncond
+  eor #$ff
   and $648e
++ sta $648e
   rts

Saves 22 bytes, plus eliminates 19 bytes of tables!


Redundant Flags:
================
026 entered shyron => just use warp point 2fd
032 got eye glasses from clark => 08d
08f calmed sea => 283

Unread Flags:
=============

054 used shell flute => never read?
0a1 cleared on entering amazones, set on paralyze portoa outer guard - unread?
    NOTE: also in NPC paralysis table 35045, so that's a wrinkle
0a2 cleared outside portoa castle
058 paralysis flag for 26 aryllis guard - not actually used!
059 paralysis flag for 27 aryllis guard - not actually used!
06d paralysis flag for zebu - never read?
06e paralysis flag for tornel - never read?
06f paralysis flag for asina - never read?

Flags to Defrag:
================
0a3 queen/fortune teller state
0a4 woke kensu
0a5 initial dialog w/ zebu student
0a6 oak elder dialog switch
0a7 swan dancer dialog toggle
0a8 oak elder dialog, oak trigger
0a9 leaf rabbit, sabre trigger
0d5 portoa queen dialog toggles
0d6 portoa queen dialog toggles
0d7 portoa queen dialog toggles
0d9 stoned pair dialog toggles
0da kensu chase flag
0db sabera trap trigger flag
0e0 dead akahana
0e8 dead shyron villager
0e9 dead shyron guard
0ea tower message
0eb tower message
0ec tower message
0ed mesia dialog toggle

Unused Flags:
=============
0ac
0e1 .. 0e3
0ee .. 0ff



REARRANGEMENT:
==============
 * Given that all the 0fx flags are unused, consider moving boss flags into
   that range: 100 => 0f0, and so on.
 * Move scaling to 64a6,64a7 (170..17f)
 * Keep overflow buffer at 180..1ff

We now have 100..16f free for actual items - only need a handful
 - 143, 144, etc.

This will allow separating items from checks cleanly.
 - we can then go ahead and delete all the chest spawn flags...!

rom/flag.ts -> include a table that incidates which flags have hardcoded
               access, defrag the rest automatically???
