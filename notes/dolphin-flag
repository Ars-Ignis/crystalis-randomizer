Goal: Attach a flag to whether the player is *currently* riding dolphin

Currently stored in $710:40
 - bit is removed at $35b94
 - also removed at $3e7b1
 - bit is set at $3d29b

Should be as simple as finding an unused flag and setting/clearing it.
 - 0ee seems like a winner (649d:40)
     lda $649d
     ora #$40
     sta $649d  =>  8 bytes, 9 if rts

This seems to work, but another option would be to actually edit the map.
We could define an alternate tile based on the dolphin flag and see what
happens - it may be the case that it responds dynamically.  Then we could
cover the cave with actual impassible water, and it only becomes passible
when on the dolphin...  Alternatively, just a whirlpool would get the job
done as well...  Unfortunately, it only updates the flags when you enter
the area.  There's clearly a "reload" function somewhere, so we'd need to
call that, and I'm not sure it's worth it.
