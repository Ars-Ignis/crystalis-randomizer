Why does it take a while to get the "no room" message?

When we come out of ItemGet (indirectly via $3d853) we check $23.
If we couldn't gain the item, then it's negative and we jump to $3d880
and reset the game mode.  The dialog is only shown if $23 is positive.

But $3d47c (the caller) checks for zero lower nibble on global timer
and shows a message anyway.  If we get rid of that, then the message
pops back up immediately as soon as you dismiss it, unless you buffer
a direction to move away.

Maybe we can call into the statue dialog code to push the player away?
Or only show the dialog if pressing a direction?
 -> this works!

How to show what item we would have gotten?

Edit the "too many items" message (20:0f) to include [:ITEM:].
This looks for the item ID in $07dc, and we already saved that
earlier in PatchStartItemGet (normally it's not written until
later).  So we don't even need to store it again, just show the
message.
