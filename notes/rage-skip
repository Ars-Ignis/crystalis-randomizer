Rage skip wants flyer to come from certain direction.  If the spawn point is
in a bad place, then it will be very hard to accomplish.

1. Update requirement to require flyer on a timed slot
2. Put all flyers on timed slots at 0,0
3. Update TryNpcSpawn to recognize 0,0 and spawn in a random offscreen location

Should never be an initial spawn, so no worry about that...
 - will just try again next spawn frame
