The tilesets are not nearly as efficient as they could be.
We could consolidate them and gain a ton of real estate.

In particular,
 * Lime tree lake (94) uses ~37 tiles in a tileset shared with
   sea and (non-river) mountain.  The tileset currently has only
   24 free tiles, but we could get a lot more (e.g. to open up
   reusing more different screens for sea) by moving Lime tree
   elsewhere
 * Shrine (98) is its own complete tileset, but has 112 free
   tiles.
 * Swamp and house (a0) have 52 free tiles (fewer when doors
   are added).  Swamp is only 74 tiles, which could be
   consolidated elsewhere if it helped.
 * Ice cave (a8) somehow has 103 (!) free tiles: it could
   possibly host swamp (though it's short flagged tiles), or
   Dyna (ac, 101 tiles).
 * Both mountain tilesets (94 and 9c) fit in 96 tiles (0..5f).
   They're highly entangled, but could possibly be consolidated
   into a single tileset to great effect.  98 is a good candidate
   for this.

The main question is where we want extras.  Sea (94) could
definitely use the help, as could desert (9c), grass (80),
river (90), fortress (8c), and cave (88).

Possible options:
 * Lime tree into swamp/house
 * Mountain into shrine -> free up sea AND desert
