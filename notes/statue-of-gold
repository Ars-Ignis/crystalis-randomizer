Goal: Randomize statue of gold trade-in

Problem:
 * Current ItemUse action jump just swaps out the broken statue with
   the statue of gold, but doesn't run any of the ItemGet actions.
 * Calling GrantItemInRegisterA or ItemGet or anything else causes
   a crash.

But there _are_ items that give other items.  We just need to consolidate
the other turn-ins to share the same action.  Maybe add a data table to
look up the current item and what it trades for.

Glowing Lamp:
  - Message 20:06 action 05 (rts)

Statue of Onyx:
  - Expect NPC 16
  - Message 02:02 action 1c
  - Set 050

Love Pendant:
  - Expect NPC 7e
  - Message 13:02 action 0c
  - Set 03c

Kirisa Plant:
  - Expect NPC 23
  - Message 12:10 action 0d
  - Set 010

Ivory Statue:
  - Expect NPC 75
  - Message 00:00 action 0e
  - Set 065


ItemOrTriggerActionJump_0d ($3d6e7)
When this runs, it looks like $23 is the item that was traded in.
We need to switch it to look it up from a table to see what item to give.

Then switch the statue fix to just return normally and use the itemuse data
to trigger the action.
