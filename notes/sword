Scaling swords

* Use upgrades, rather than element, to determine damage
  - Sword only: 5
  - Sword + Ball: 7
  - Sword + Bracelet: 11
* Fixed damage from stab across all swords: 2

Under this model, the damage the player deals will vary from 8 (at level 1 and no upgrades)
to 29 (at level 16 with all upgrades).  Round this up to 32, since warrior/power ring will
be available by then.

Across 47 items, this amounts to a 0.5 increase per each.  This makes the mid-game slightly
easier since you're likely to have found matching balls and bracelets sooner (though we
didn't account for matching sword, so it's a little longer).

Monster scaled DEF is a number from 0..7, except for special cases.
Indicates how many points should be from def, how many fro hp
At diff 0, <PAtk> = 8, SDEF 4 -> DEF 4 -> 4 dmg per hit
At diff 16, <PAtk> = 16, SDEF 4 -> DEF 8 -> 8 dmg per hit
At diff 48, <PAtk> = 32, SDef 4 -> DEF 16 -> 16 dmg per hit

This doesn't scale well to draygon 2.
How about, DEF = max(0, PAtk - SDEF) * SDEF / 8
Note: In vanilla, storm bracelet on Draygon 2 w/ power ring does 7*10 damage

At lvl 16, max difficulty, SDef 10, this would be DEF=22*1.25=30 but cf atk 51 -> 20 per hit
 - may need special handling for bosses where charged shots are more likely?

Power ring could just double the object damage?
 - so +2 for stab, +8 for storm, etc?
 - not quite as game-breaking...
 - or add level for charges only

SDEF stores two numbers: (1) DEF as a fraction of <PAtk> (in 8ths) and (2) expected sword level
 -> 4 bits for each => if low >7 then need high to be nonzero!

Or maybe just a straight up difference between PAtk and DEF?
 - will want to allow negatives for bosses

Draygon 2, diff 30 -> patk=21, sdef=3 -> def=24
                lvl=11 => 11+16=27 -> 3 per hit, 14 with power ring

           OR just a bit to say whether to assume power ring?
             - in which case just add the level ?
           OR <<1 so draygon2 would base on 6+16=22 per hit

           sword adj = 12  =>  9 per hit, 20 hits --> 180
           diff 48 -> patk=29, sdef=3 -> def=32
                lvl=16 => 32 -> 0 per hit, 16 w/ power 
                 adj = 12  =>  12 per hit, 20 hits --> 240

How important is the sword adjustment?  In general we can ignore it since
we're balancing the swords out, but it's still important for super-high DEF
fights.  This probably only applies to Draygon and Dyna.
 - given this, just hardcode their behavior?
 - for the standard case, multiply by PAtk, should not be more than 7/8.

Power ring will be a 16/hit swing, and at high DEF that's a big scale factor
 - if we make def == max atk then power ring is only 16 hits (rather than 25)
   yet no power ring is 255.
 - clearly we need to nerf the power ring - even just adding the level on top
   again only for projectiles is still over-powered.  We could double the
   projectile damage?  This emphasizes water too much... also hard to implement
   because same code path for sword and shot.


DEF is what causes power ring to be so OP
But it's also the main driving force for grinding
Power ring alternatively means you only need to grind to half

Consider a compromise - DEF stat is split in 2
  - 2 bits for shift, 6 for subtraction
  - DMG = (ATK + SWD - DEF) >> DSH

Effectively allows HP up to 2048.

Draygon 2
 - at diff 20, PAtk=18, SDef=0.75 => DEF=13
   sword adjust = 6, hits = 30
   => expected dmg = 11 => HP = 330 (165, 1)
   lvl 9 => 17 w/, 33 without
   lvl 12 => 13 w/, 24 without

 - at diff 30, PAtk=23, SDef=0.75 => DEF=17
   sword adjust = 6, hits = 30
   => expected dmg = 12 => HP = 360 (180, 1)
   lvl 10 => 24 hits w/ power ring, 48 without
   lvl 13, no power ring => 13+8+8 = 29 => 12/hit => 30 hits
   lvl 13, w/ power ring => 26+8+8 = 42 => 25/hit => 15 hits
   lvl 16, w/ power ring =>   + 6 =>  48 => 31    => 12 hits
 - at diff 47, PAtk=31, SDef=0.75, DEF=23
   sword adj = 6, hits = 30
   => expected dmg = 31 + 6 = 37 => 14  => HP = 420
   lvl 16 => 42 w/o, 16 w/  => power ring more important at high difficulty
   lvl 13 => 105 w/o, 24 w/    makes it possible at all to kill...

possibly we actually want 0.875 or even 1.0 DEF to really force/reward grinding...

Draygon 2
 - at diff 20, PAtk=18, SDef=0.875 => DEF=15
   sword adjust = 6, hits = 30
   => expected dmg = 9 => HP = 270 (135, 1)
   lvl 6 => 21 w/, 39 without
   lvl 9 => 19 w/, 27 without

 - at diff 30, PAtk=23, SDef=0.875 => DEF=20
   sword adjust = 6, hits = 30
   => expected dmg = 9 => HP = 270 (135, 1)
   lvl 10 => 17 hits w/ power ring, 45 without
   lvl 13 => 13 w/, 30 w/o, 17 power stabs
   lvl 16, w/ power ring =>   + 6 =>  48 => 31    => 12 hits
 - at diff 47, PAtk=31, SDef=0.875, DEF=27
   sword adj = 6, hits = 30
   => expected dmg = 31 + 6 = 37 => 10  => HP = 300
   lvl 16 => 42 w/o, 16 w/  => power ring more important at high difficulty
   lvl 13 => 150 w/o, 20 w/    makes it possible at all to kill...

NOTE: -3 w/ power ring is *always* going to be better than at-level w/o if lvl>3...

Draygon 2 => 7/8, +8, 30 hits
Most others => just use whatever it already was /8, don't adjust sword...

Note: we can still stab draygon in a reasonable number of hits
