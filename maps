* Lime tree

| $14 | $18 | $2a | $0e |
| $0c | $35 | $16 | $0d |
| $0f | $02 | $37 | $10 |
| $90 | $10 | $0e | $0f |

or just keep same size and replace (0, 1) tile with $1a

next screen:

  anim: 1
  screens: $a8
    - could also turn down/up w/ $a9/$ab on left or $b9*/$af on right
      * $b9 does not work quite as well - bigger exit
    - $b4 is straight left/right, could even put in a "patch cave" with $b8
      and send through to Sahara area, or leaf?
  pal: $6 (or $a, $d, $16, $42, $53, $83, $87), $12 (irrelevant?), $18 (or $1f)
  tileset: $9c, $ba
  pat: $14, $04

    - also need a flag, obviously


one-way passage -> giant hole in cave - could make several holey screens and pass
  through all to simulate a huge drop...?

 - what other blockers could we introduce between leaf and goa?

   -- otherwise it's still just a little too predictable?

 - really probably want to open things up.
   - non-blocked connectors to everything? or random unblocking?

   --> figure out how to add blocked and unblocked connections between areas
       - one simple way is open (or semi-open) warp.

================================================================


* Swamp ($1a)
Change (4, 2) to $7d to make a right-hand exit, or a bottom exit by changing
(3, 4) to $78 or {(3, 4) to $7d and (4, 4) to $7e}
 - what could it connect to?
 - could go to Leaf for a gas-mask connection to somewhere...
 - could also randomize the whole swamp maze
 - in "totally nuts" mode, could even hide random chests in it.


* Coverage
Tile $93 was unused in full2.mov. Where is it?  $9d also, except for $9dfx,
which may not be related?!?  $be unused (it's same as $bd!)
 - looks like they're not actually used, either - they're different kinds of
   pits.  We could coopt any of these for a new map structure if we wanted to.
   - different kind of water crossing or west exit?



* Blockers

** Ball of X
Easy - put a wall (or river) in the way
 - Flight eliminates need for ball of water

** Rabbit boots
Can put a slide, possibly even outside Mt Sabre (see waterfall valley)
 - could we do two slides so that both directions require the boots?
 - may not need to block both directions.

** Leather boots
Giant area of desert mush?  Would be hard to pull off.

** Gas mask
Particularly useful if we make the swamp a pass-through.

** Flute of Lime
Only if the glitch is fixed, and only good once.

** Flight
Cross rivers, but also invalidates ball of water, etc, so not great to use.

** Change
Used in Shyron, Amazones, Swan - not obvious how to take advantage.

** Various keys
If we randomize all the entrances, this could be interesting, but otherwise not so much
 - e.g. windmill key leading into styx

** Shell flute
Again, useful if we randomize entrances, but otherwise just blocks Joel/Sabera
 - could do an early shell flute and add a bunch of caves and entrances to all over...?
