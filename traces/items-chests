How do chests get filled?

Enter cave, $68c..$68f get set variously in either $3c2a3 or $3e2f3
 -> no difference before/after waking man or before/after getting item
 - dig into where the bit is used?  must be clearing something...

but windmill key it was already unset???
 - dialog options, maybe?
 - chests need to get unset, but dialog can be lazier...

NOTE:
 - dialog items disappear if inventory full, unlike chests...
   - find a way to repeat the dialog if that happens???
