Crystalis Debug Mode
====================

Many people are aware of the "wild warp" feature that was left in Crystalis, but there's also a debug mode that was disabled.  This patch re-enables it.  After applying this patch, debug mode may be entered as follows:

1. Hold A+B on controller 1 while booting the game.  Note that a soft reset is insufficient to trigger this.
2. Press START during the game to pull up the status screen.
3. Press the DPAD on controller 2 to
   - fill the inventory with all swords and bracelets
   - fill all armor, shield, and consumable slots with various items
   - set level to 15 (internally - display is not updated)
   - set MP to maximum (255)
4. Press A on controller 2 to turn on "high speed" mode.
   - in this mode, the player moves at a very high speed and is mostly invincible
