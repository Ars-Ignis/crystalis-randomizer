# Converting CHR to pattern strings

Place any .chr dump from a rom image here and run the gulp task
`gulp buildchr` to create a javascript file with each of the
different tiles in text form.

The contents of the CHR or the generated JS should only be included
in the source tree if we are actively using those tiles.
