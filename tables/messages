00:00 Did you visit the elder's               $2a000
      house yet?
00:01 If you go to the west, you              $2a01c
      will find Zebu in a cave.
00:02 Thank you for saving me!                $2a036
00:03 There is an old windmill to             $2a046
      the north, but I've never 
      seen it working.
00:04 If you ever need to wake                $2a077
      anyone up, use the Alarm
      Flute, it never fails.
00:05 Thank you for saving me!                $2a036
00:06 The wind here is always                 $2a0ab
      cold but we're used to it.
00:07 I'm sorry you have to                   $2a0cb
      leave, take care.
00:08 Thank you for saving me!                $2a036
00:09 Hey!! There's a guy coming              $2a0e6
      out of the cave!
00:0a Oh, it's you. I'm sorry I               $2a101
      ran from you when we first
      met.

00:15 What are you?  It's strange             $2a29f
      you can understand me.
00:16 Some evil people attacked               $2a2c4
      and took everyone away.
00:17 Are you the one who saved               $2a2ea

      you are the one we have

      Try to make the windmill
      work. If you can do this 
      I will teach you some

00:1b You have done well. I will              $2a39f
      now teach you the magic of 
      Refresh.
00:1c The wind is filled with                 $2a3bc
      sorrow. Return to Leaf 
      soon.
00:1d Use your power to open the              $2a3e4
      way.
01:00 zzz…                                    $2a3f7
01:01 Huh? What was that?                     $2a3fd
      Don't do that again!▼
      It's you. Please don't

02:00 This town is mostly for                 $2a4a5
      travelers. Pretty noisy
      isn't it.
02:01 I'm Akahana. I used to                  $2a4d2
      have an unusual statue
      but I dropped it near the ▼
       river. It was a great
      find and will be difficult
      to replace.
      Have you seen it?

      Akahana is handed a statue.▼
      Hey, this is my statue.
      Thank you for finding it.
      If you need to go to the ▼
       forest, use this Gas Mask 
      to avoid the poison.
02:03 If you go east, you will                $2a59b
      find the forest.  It's a
      grand maze where plants
      will shoot poison.
02:04 I've heard that there's a               $2a5dc
      village where only women
      live. I wonder…
02:05 The village of Oak lies                 $2a60f
      deep in the forest.  The
      people there don't 
      understand our language.
02:06 The wise man Tornel lives               $2a657
      with his pupils in the 
      north.
02:07 There are two routes to                 $2a680
      Mt.Sabre ; one west and 
      one north.  Both roads are 
      very dangerous.
02:08 I just found out how to get             $2a6c3
      rich quick. Later!
02:09 I told him that I made                  $2a6e2
      a lot of money from stones
      I found on Mt.Sabre.
      After that he got excited…
02:0a I'm the first pupil of                  $2a727
      Zebu. You must bow down
      before me!
02:0b That man is dead isn't he…              $2a751
      He'd still be alive if I
      hadn't told him…
02:0c That man is dead isn't he…              $2a751
      He'd still be alive if I
      hadn't told him…
03:00 I am Tornel. If you are                 $2a790
      truly a legendary soldier
      you should be able to ▼
       defeat Stom easily. Just
      force your opponent against
      the back wall.
03:01 Excellent! I will                       $2a802
      now teach you the magic of 
      Telepathy…▼
      This allows you to 
      communicate with animals.
      It also allows you to ▼
       speak with us wise men
      when you have problems,
      even if you are not near.▼
      I will now go to the 
      training place. If you 
      find the Tornado Bracelet 
      SIMEA, bring it to me.
03:02 You still lack the proper               $2a8b2
      skill. Come back when you 
      think you are able.
03:03 I'm Stom training under                 $2a8e3
      Tornel. SIMEA! Let's
      have at it!
03:04 A busy town, Brynmaer, is               $2a904
      located south of the 
      sealed cave.  You should
      visit there.
03:05 The Tornado Bracelet is                 $2a93c
      somewhere in Mt.Sabre.
      It will maximize the power 
      of the Sword of Wind.
03:06 I'll, be waiting…                       $2a964
04:00 I haven't seen my boy since             $2a972
      he went into the forest.
      Have you seen him?
04:01 I am forever indebted to                $2a9a3
      you! Please take this 
      as a reward.
04:02 Thank you again for all                 $2a9ca
      your help.
04:03 Thank you again for all                 $2a9ca
      your help.
04:04 Waah! Waah! I'm afraid!                 $2a9e0
      I want to go home! Can you 
      please take me home?
04:05 Waah! Waah! I'm afraid!                 $2a9e0
      I want to go home! Can you

04:06 I'll be good from now on.               $2aa13

      We don't like humans here!
04:09 This is the village of Oak.             $2aa24

04:0a The Insect Flute is a                   $2aa4c
      powerful item, but it's
      dangerous because of the 
      poisonous insects it calls.
04:0b I heard there are training              $2aa93
      grounds for wise men on 
      the west side. Perhaps you 
      should go there.
04:0c The village elder will not              $2aad9
      talk to humans.
04:0d The village elder will not              $2aad9

04:0e We shun most humans but I               $2aaf8
      think you are different
      than most.
04:0f We have reconsidered                    $2ab22
      humans.
04:10 ……                                      $2ab3b

      You're quite strange.
04:12 You're great! I think I'll              $2ab5c
      believe in you.
04:13 The air in my house smells              $2ab7e
      like humans. Get out!

04:15 You saved the child?                    $2aba5
      I thank you. I now ask a
      favor of you…▼
       There is a monster in the 
      poison swamp. Many of our
      dwarves were eaten by this ▼
       creature… The monster 
      cannot attack the village
      because of an object▼
       we possess, but we cannot 
      use. I leave this object
      in your care, to save the 
      village…
04:16 Please do it!                           $2ac7e
04:17 Hmm, you destroyed the                  $2ac85
      monster. Good, we now can 
      live without fear…▼
      SIMEA! You are the one who
      saved us. Our precious
      object belongs to you.▼
       With this we express
      appreciation. Please keep 
      it with you.▼
       We will tell all of your 
      feat. You will forever be 
      a hero among the dwarves.
      Again many thanks.

      rest well!
04:1a Go in peace.                            $2ad72
05:00 Welcome my guest. I am                  $2ad7e
      Nadare.  Get rested and 
      awake refreshed.
05:01 I have no food for you.                 $2adb1
05:02 Not long ago a guy from                 $2adbe
      Brynmaer left to climb the 
      mountain. I envy the 
      youth with so much energy.
05:03 That guy from Brynmaer                  $2ae03
      hasn't returned yet.▼
      What? He's dead?
      I… I'm sorry…
05:04 Be careful.                             $2ae41
05:05 The trail is blocked off                $2ae4e
      and strange people wander 
      there. It's quite weird.
05:06 The trail is passable now               $2ae86
      and those weird people 
      have disappeared.
05:07 It seems some traveler made             $2aeb7
      those weird people on the 
      trail disappear. I wonder 
      how he is.
05:08 The food here is great! I               $2aefb
      wish I could eat like
      this always.
05:09 I may be old now, but in my             $2af2b
      youth, I could climb many
      mountains easily.▼
       My son Nadare is still a
      wimp compared to me.
      Ha ha ha.
05:0a Tornel:"You've found me,                $2af98
      but you have to find the 
      Tornado Bracelet before
      I teach you more magic."
05:0b Tornel:"SIMEA!                          $2afc4

      back. I'll now teach you…"▼

      "Have a safe journey."
05:0e …it's you… I had a dream I              $2b05f
      could strike it rich…
      But alas… I failed…▼
       I was captured… by some 
      strange people… they put
      me in a cave…▼
       I also saw people from

      forced to work…▼
       But I escaped… And they

      SIMEA:"Hold on! Hold on!"▼
      Oh, to have tasted Nadare's
      food again… I… am… eh…
      aaah………
05:0f Guard:"Are those worthless              $2b157
      villagers working well?"▼
      Guard:"Well, they're used 
      to the cold weather and I
      haven't heard complaints…▼
      Guard:"But of course it's
      difficult to complain
      when you're not allowed…▼
      "He he he he… We must make 
      them work harder, he he…"▼
      "Long live the 
      Draygonia Empire!"
05:10 Who are you? You cannot                 $2b236
      pass here! Attack!
06:00 I'm the great General                   $2b255
      Kelbesque. I'm one of 
      Draygonia's finest four.▼
       Wimp! You will now see the 
      wrath of my power!
06:01 Don't think you've seen                 $2b29e
      even a fraction of my 
      power. Next time you see
      me, it will be your last!
07:00 The elder is held prisoner              $2b2e3
      at the top of the mountain
      and they will kill him if
      we don't work!
07:01 The people of Draygonia are             $2b322
      making a special metal
      from the minerals we dig
      here.
07:02 I heard that part of the                $2b353
      prison wall is connected 
      to the top…
07:03 There are village people in             $2b381
      the next prison as well!
07:04 So you saved us, big deal.              $2b3b0
07:05 Thank you for saving me.                $2b3a0

07:08 So you saved us, big deal.              $2b3b0
07:09 Oh SIMEA… Are the rest of               $2b3c7
      the villagers OK? I really
      appreciate your efforts.▼
       SIMEA!
      Proceed back into the 
      cave…▼
       It'll lead you to Portoa.
      I heard the Queen there 
      has strange powers.▼
       Surely she will aid you.
07:0a Now please be careful.                  $2b45e
08:00 The Queen is in the center              $2b471
      chamber.
08:01 We'll do anything for the               $2b485
      Queen.
08:02 The Queen is our jewel! She             $2b499
      is our sun and moon!
08:03 Hey! Don't wander around                $2b4bb
      the Queen's room!
08:04 Don't be rude to the Queen.             $2b4d9
08:05 I was instructed to show                $2b4e6
      you the underground channel
      when you arrived.
      Please enter.
08:06 The Queen wishes to see no              $2b520
      one today. Be gone!
08:07 The Queen left to travel.               $2b543
      don't tell anyone.
08:08 The Queen is very kind and              $2b55f
      intelligent.
08:09 The Queen sometimes                     $2b574
      disappears from her room.
      I wonder how she leaves
      without anyone noticing?
08:0a I haven't seen the Queen                $2b5c0
      lately. I wonder how she's
      doing.
08:0b Hey, don't bother me! I've              $2b5e5
      got to worry about fixing 
      the Queen's meal!
08:0c I'm sorry about our last                $2b61c
      meeting. Evans has taught
      me better manners since
      then. Ha ha.
08:0d I'm Evans. I teach                      $2b662
      etiquette here.
08:0e I'm Evans. I teach                      $2b662
      etiquette here.
08:0f I married Geline who was my             $2b67c
      pupil. I must thank the 
      Queen for arranging our
      meeting.
08:10 This is Portoa, the capital             $2b6b2
      of water. Water from Mt.
      Sabre makes this town 
      prosper.
08:11 I heard Draygonia wants to              $2b6eb
      invade this town because
      they are afraid of the 
      Queen's power.
08:12 Some people went up to the              $2b722
      waterfall, but haven't 
      returned yet. I heard a▼
       monster lives up there.
      Also a greedy man called 
      Akahana went there and 
      hasn't returned either.
08:13 A girl from the southern                $2b793
      lake came here. I think
      she went to rent a boat.
08:14 A fortune teller in the                 $2b7c3
      town is very good, but 
      she's not always there.
08:15 The fortune teller does                 $2b7f3
      very well here, it's a
      pity she's rarely open.
09:00 We're not open right now.               $2b82a
      Go away!
09:01                                         $2b844
              The owner 
         accepts the Fog Lamp.▼
      You went into the cave to 
      give this to me? You have 
      great courage. Please use 
      my boat as you like.
09:02 Don't hesitate. Use it                  $2b892
      freely.
09:03 You don't give up easily.               $2b8ac
09:04 My father lost his Fog Lamp             $2b8bb
      and is rather upset. You 
      should come back later.
09:05 That Fog Lamp is very                   $2b8ed
      beautiful.
09:06 My father went out to look              $2b903
      for his lamp. He won't be 
      back for a while.
0a:00 I'm the Fortune Teller. Let             $2b931
      me see your fortune.
      Hmmmmmm…▼
      See the Queen. Your way 
      will be open.
0a:01 Hmmmmmm… Go to the palace,              $2b977
      your way will definitely
      be opened.
0a:02 Hmmmmmm… Something in the               $2b9a4
      darkness is calling you.
      Carry on, but don't get 
      lost.
0a:03 Hmmmmmm… Some one will wait             $2b9db
      for you at the lake in the 
      south.
0a:04 I'm the Queen of Portoa.                $2b9fc
      Are you the legendary man
      who climbed through Sabre?▼
       It's too peaceful here.
      I'm bored. May we talk
      a while?▼
       How does the town look to 
      you? We take pride in it's
      beauty.
0a:05 SIMEA, I was looking                    $2ba8f
      forward to seeing you.▼
      Have you gotten used to 
      life in the town?

0a:07 SIMEA, come closer to me.               $2bac6
      ▼
      I would like to be an 
      adventurer like you, to 
      see what lies beyond here.
0a:08 SIMEA, what's wrong? Don't              $2bb15
       be so shy.▼
      The owner of the 
      boat rental shop is kind 
      only to his daughter.
0a:09 SIMEA, I enjoy talking                  $2bb62
      with you.▼
      The food Geline cooks for 
      me is very good, but alas
      her manners are not…▼
      I will ask Evans to teach
      her some manners.
0a:0a It's gotten late. I had a               $2bbca
      good time though. I must 
      go now.
0a:0b Sing some more!                         $2bbf9
0a:0c Oh, SIMEA. Did you know                 $2bc02
      there's a cave behind the 
      northern waterfall?▼
      Go there. I'll give you 
      the Flute of Lime.
      Use it wisely.
0a:0d Ah, you finally found the               $2bc52
      Sword of Water. Go to the 
      Lime Tree in south lake.▼
       When you are finished 
      there, come back.

0a:0f 10-0F                                   $2bcaa
0b:00 It's time I told you the                $2bcb1
      truth…
      The fortune teller is…▼
       really me. I entered town 
      like this and heard
      people's problems…▼
       But the real me is neither 
      the fortune teller or the 
      Queen…▼
       I am Asina, one of three
      great wise men who will

0b:03 Asina:"Oh, this is a gift               $2bde0
      I gave to someone I'll 
      never forget… I wonder……"
0c:00 I'm in such pain! Do you                $2be14
      have any herbs that would
      help me?
0c:01 Thank you. Because of your              $2be3b
      kindness I can now return
      to the sea. Take this ▼
       and use it when you wish

      out for a minute… I'm 
      Ralph the elder of Joel.▼
       Someone came from the next 
      island and asked for a
      girl sacrifice if we wish▼
       safety to our island. One
      from Portoa volunteered 
      though… She's monster prey
      by now.
0f:01 Thank you. Our village is               $2c201
      saved.
0f:02 Oh, it's you. Thanks again.             $2c21f
0f:03 Welcome to the glorious                 $2c235
      island of Joel!
0f:04 This is no place for you!               $2c24c
      Leave here!
0f:05 I don't want to be a                    $2c265
      sacrifice. Where's my 
      Uncle Clark?
0f:06 Now I don't have to be                  $2c28f
      sacrificed! Yah!
0f:07 Oh, it's you. Thanks again.             $2c21f

      I pray for her safety.

0f:0a This is Joel Island. The                $2c2e9
      next one to the west is 
      Evil Spirit Island.
0f:0b Good, good, good.                       $2c315
0f:0c Since a woman sorcerer from             $2c31f
      Draygonia went to the next
      island, it's been weird…▼
       People have disappeared 
      and strange monsters now 
      live there.
0f:0d At last, our life can                   $2c388
      return to normal. I can go 
      back to fishing now.
0f:0e Lately the fishing has been             $2c3c1
      great. The fisherman next 
      door has been loving it.
0f:0f Clark, who is the elder's               $2c3f7
      brother, has not returned

0f:10 Clark was safe? That's                  $2c428
      great.
0f:11 Life was like a nightmare               $2c440
      before…
0f:12 Hey! You surprised me! I                $2c463
      thought you were a
      monster.
0f:13 Now I can live safely.                  $2c489
0f:14 Sometimes I help out at the             $2c49a
      next island.
0f:15 Clark:"Everybody has been               $2c4b0

      A woman sorcerer is here…▼
       She came from Draygonia 
      and changed all the people 
      here into zombies.▼
      Sabera is very clever.
      Be careful.
10:01 Clark:"You did it! Awesome!             $2c5b2
      Please take this… I'm 
      sure it will help you."
10:02 Clark:"Now I can go home.               $2c5dd
      Surely Ralph and others
      are waiting for me."
10:03 Thank you. Because of your              $2c608
      valliant effort, we are 
      released from this curse.▼
      I don't know how to thank
      you…  We will rebuild now…
10:04 We'll rebuild this place                $2c660

      in an underground river."
13:01 Kensu:"I hate people who                $2cc76
      are pushy."
13:02                                         $2cc90
            Love Pendant 
         is given to Kensu.▼
      Kensu:"This was given to 
      me by Asina as proof of 
      her belief in me."▼
      "As promised, I'll teach
      you the magic of Change.
      Now I must attend to other 
      things. Go to Mt.Hydra."
13:03 Many thanks for your                    $2cd15
      promise.
13:04 Do your best.                           $2cd2e
13:05 Have you seen that                      $2cd39
      great one Kensu 
      around here at all?
13:06 Kensu:"Shoot!                           $2cd62
13:07 This is Swan. Draygonia                 $2cd6e
      Castle and Goa are to the 
      north.▼
      I hear Goa is becoming 
      stronger from some 
      new type of metal…
13:08 After people of Draygonia               $2cdbb
      are gone, the utmost fear
      of the people is released.
13:09 I hear the people against               $2cde7
      Draygonia are killed… or 
      forced to leave… There are 
      many hiding with Azteca……
13:0a Draygonia will soon be                  $2ce23
      destroyed!
13:0b They say Draygonia's new                $2ce38
      metal armor can even
      withstand earth's magma…▼
       That means they can easily
      attack Shyron fort… Not
      good at all.
13:0c When I heard Shyron was                 $2cea2
      destroyed, I thought for 
      sure it was over…
13:0d The people of Draygonia                 $2ced4
      are wonderful. Ha ha ha.
13:0e People saying bad things                $2cef2
      against Draygonia were 
      executed… My husband……
13:0f Stom:"I haven't seen you                $2cf2b
      for a while. I came to 
      give you a message…"▼
      "Please find Kensu and take 
      him to Shyron. We need his 
      power. I'm counting on 
      you!"
13:10 Draygonia… Wise men… who                $2cf87
      cares. Let's party!
13:11 Very nice!                              $2cfae
13:12 Yah man, let's boogie!                  $2cfba
13:13 Wherever you go, the                    $2cfd2
      brightness of your sword
      will help you.
13:14 How dare you come here!                 $2cff4
      Leave immediately!
13:15 Very well… On your way.                 $2d016
14:00 This is Shyron fort. I                  $2d028
      can't let strange people 
      in.
14:01 Hello Stom. Please enter.               $2d04c
14:02 How dare you come here!                 $2cff4
      Leave immediately!
14:03 Hey! Draygonia is                       $2d05f
      attacking!
14:04 Good luck.                              $2d070
14:05 This is Shyron. People                  $2d078
      come here to train to be 
      wise men and hide out from ▼
       Draygonia as well. But 
      even this place isn't safe
      anymore.
14:06 On the way here, I lost my              $2d0c1
      wife and children…
14:07 Akahana:"Hi, do you                     $2d0e2
      remember me? I live here 
      because the people from ▼
       my home town of Goa 
      have changed… I felt very
      uncomfortable there."
14:08 Akahana:"When I went home               $2d13d
      everyone had changed, I
      felt no longer welcome."
14:09 Akahana:"Be careful."                   $2d172
14:0a Tornel:"Good, you finally               $2d17c
      made it. We're training 
      these people here."▼
      "We have a lack of men and 
      are having troubles.
      Because of that armor…▼
      "…we are losing the battle.
      Our medical staff can't 
      keep up with the wounded."
14:0b Tornel:"The enemy is so                 $2d20a
      close. Be careful!"
14:0c Stom:"The people training               $2d224
      here are all fools. I'm 
      worried."
14:0d Stom:"After Draygonia is                $2d24b
      destroyed, we'll have a
      rematch. This time I won't 
      lose."
14:0e Eyaah! Heey! Yoww!                      $2d283
14:0f Eiyaaah!                                $2d297
14:10 Asina:"SIMEA! Zebu is                   $2d2a1
      waiting for you in the 
      back of the temple, see
      him immediately."
14:11 Asina:"SIMEA! Zebu is                   $2d2a1
      waiting for you in the 
      back of the temple, see
      him immediately."
14:12 Asina:"You are my last                  $2d2dc
      hope."
14:13 Asina is helping the                    $2d2ea
      wounded around the clock.
14:14 Be careful…                             $2d30a
14:15 Oooo… Owww…                             $2d30f
14:16 Oooo… Give me water… Oooo…              $2d31c
14:17 Zebu:"Great! You made it                $2d335
      this far. Besides the 
      three swords you now…"▼
      "…possess, the most 
      powerful, the Sword of 
      Thunder, is in the cave…"▼
      "…of Styx. Evil spirits
      keep us from invading 
      there. Watch yourself."▼
      "The gate to Styx is at the 
      top of Mt.Hydra. Take 
      this key and go."
14:18 Zebu:"Be careful!"                      $2d6be
15:00 Akahana:"That's a mirror."              $2d3f5
15:01 Akahana:"Hello,                         $2d40a
      how are you?"
15:02 Akahana:"Aaaah! Please                  $2d41c
      spare my life!"
15:03 Tornel:"You are vain to                 $2d436
      change yourself in front
      of me."
15:04 Tornel:"Your appearance is              $2d45e
      now quite whimsical."
15:05 Stom:"You're SIMEA, aren't              $2d488
      you? I know who you are."
15:06 Stom:"You do that very                  $2d4a8
      well. It's as if I was 
      looking in a mirror."
15:07 Asina:"We can see through               $2d4d4
      your disguise."
15:08 Asina:"You shouldn't                    $2d4f5
      surprise people without 
      reason."
15:09 Hello.                                  $2d51c
15:0a Aaah! Stom help me!                     $2d524
15:0b Oh Stom! Don't stare at me.             $2d531
15:0c Zebu:"SIMEA. We didn't                  $2d541
      teach you that magic to 
      play with!"
16:00 Azteca:"I was waiting for               $2d566
      you. A lot has happened in 
      the past 100yrs."▼
      "You and Mesia went into 
      sleep to watch for the end 
      of the world."▼
      "You each had specific
      powers that could combat
      any future evil…"▼
      Azteca:"SIMEA! Hurry to 
      Mesia!"
16:01 Azteca:"SIMEA! Hurry to                 $2d5f6
      Mesia!"
16:02 Zebu:"We tried, through our             $2d60b
      powers, to lead the people 
      towards a good direction…"▼
      "But Draygon used this 
      power wrongly and built an 
      invading nation."▼
      "Draygon hid the fact of 
      who he was, and lured our
      best four warriors into 
      his realm of darkness."
16:03 Zebu:"Be careful!"                      $2d6be
16:04 Tornel:"Azteca is not sure              $2d6c8
      of the extent of Mesia's
      power, but Emperor…"▼
      "Draygon is trying to 
      harness it to extend his 
      realm of influence."
16:05 Tornel:"I wish for your                 $2d720
      safety."
16:06 Asina:"Your lives were                  $2d737
      mentioned to the people as 
      legends to give them hope…"▼
      "If you don't destroy
      Draygonia, all will live
      in despair."
16:07 Asina:"Now, the real battle             $2d794
      begins."
17:00 This is the fortress of                 $2d7af
      Goa.
17:01 I feel like it was all a                $2d7c4
      nightmare.
17:02 The Emperor is looking for              $2d7e2
      a tower which floats high
      in the sky.
17:03 I feel like a tremendous                $2d811
      weight has just been
      lifted.
17:04 I heard that Draygonia's                $2d83e
      best four warriors left 
      for Shyron. The wise men 
      will die for sure.
17:05 Is that so? The great four              $2d876
      were killed? Ah, the 
      Emperor is still left!
17:06 Yo! Akahana! You look good.             $2d8ac
      I'll return that item you 
      loaned me.
17:07 Let's have some refreshments            $2d8d2
      sometime.
17:08 I can't remember what life              $2d8f5
      was like before the castle
      was built.
17:09 When I met the grand puba               $2d92a
      Karmine, I felt scared,
      but one look in his eyes
      made everything OK.
17:0a Our pride is working day                $2d96d
      and night for Draygonia.
17:0b I don't care what happens               $2d98e
      to Draygonia as long as I
      can work. I'm busy.
17:0c The Emperor is the worst!               $2d9b2
      I won't forgive those who
      speak ill of him.
17:0d The Emperor is the worst!               $2d9de
      I won't forgive those who
      defend him.
17:0e Kensu:"Sorry about my                   $2da0b
      appearance, but I'm trying 
      to get some info on the…"▼
      "…tower in the sky. I'm 
      sneaking into Draygonia 
      castle to see what I…"▼
      "…can find. Draygonia sees
      this tower as a weapon
      and has big plans for…"▼
      "…it. I'll continue to see
      what information I can dig
      up. You be careful too."
17:0f I hear there's a tower with             $2daca
      enough power to destroy
      the world.
17:10 Don't look down on the                  $2daf7
      Emperor's power.
18:00 Kelbesque:"Well done so                 $2db0b
      far! Now you will join 
      the people of Shyron!"
18:01 Zebu:"Well done, but the                $2db32
      other wise men are still
      captive. I will recover 
      your strength. Take care."
18:02 Sabera:"Long time no see!               $2db74
      Ha! I won't let you get by
      me! Be prepared!"
18:03 Tornel:"I'm saved! By the               $2dba6
      way, how is Stom!"
      SIMEA:"………"▼
      Tornel:"I see… But he held
      on to the last… sigh. I
      will restore your strength.
      Avenge Stom!"
18:04 Mado:"Hoo, hoo, I'm                     $2dc10
      glad you could come.
      You're nothing to fear…
      Be proud of it!"
18:05 Asina:"Thank you SIMEA! I               $2dc4f
      will cure your wounds. The 
      last sorcerer is Karmine…"▼
      "He uses magic to change
      people into monsters, so
      be careful!"
18:06 Kensu:"Hey, it's me! I was              $2dcb1
      stupid and was hit by
      Karmine…"▼
      "In order to recover, I
      need the Ivory Statue.
      It's in a room downstairs.
      Use the hole over there."
18:07       Ivory Statue                      $2dd1c
         is given to Kensu.▼
      Kensu:"What a relief! Here,
      I will cure your wounds.
      The Emperor and Mesia…"▼
      "…left for the pyramid.
      Mesia has the power to 
      call the tower, but don't…▼
      "…give it to Draygon. I'll 
      teach you Flight to aid
      you. Now, take the short
      cut through the back."
18:08 Welcome SIMEA! I'm Karmine              $2ddd2
      Draygonia's finest! You 
      must be tired… So rest
      forever in darkness! Ha!
19:00 Akahana:"I… I should have               $2de0f
      got… uh… an item… I left 
      with a friend in G… Goa…
      Uh, uuuh………"
19:01 Stom…  hurry  Escape…                   $2de54
19:02 Stom… I'm glad…  You're                 $2de69
      safe… …
19:03 Stom:"Ooooh… Draygonia's                $2de83
      army came… Everyone 
      killed… watch out for 
      Mado…"▼
      "He is more treacherous 
      than the other three… Uh…"
      SIMEA:"Don't speak. wait."▼
      Stom:"Take care of… Tornel…
          Oooo…… …… …"
      SIMEA:"Stom, hold on!
          Stom!"
19:04 Ha!Ha! I'm Mado! I destroyed            $2df1f
      those silly wise men 
      against the Emperor.▼
      You will now join the 
      people of Shyron!
19:05 Don't think that you've                 $2df66
      won! Don't forget we still
      have Mesia and the other 
      wise men.
1a:00 This is the desert town of              $2e000
      Sahara. The weather is 
      pretty nasty, but it keeps
      Draygonia away.
1a:01 A strange couple came here              $2e03b
      a while back… One was a man 
      with a cape, the other was 
      a girl.
1a:02 Do you know someone called              $2e082
      Stom? I assume he's in 
      training right now.
1a:03 When you go through a cave              $2e0af
      in the east, a great
      Pyramid is there.
1a:04 I heard a rumor that                    $2e0e1
      Draygonia is about to be 
      destroyed…
1a:05 Oh, you are the                         $2e106
      legendary soldier… I shall
      tell you what I know…▼
      A tower with tremendous
      power is near, one that 
      can destroy the world.▼
      It is said, one true
      warrior has the power to 
      stop the tower… That one…▼
      …is SIMEA, and the one 
      who will lead you is 
      called Mesia.
      That I know.
1a:06 Mesia is waiting. Go to the             $2e1c8
      Pyramid with utmost haste!
1a:07 Mesia's power is more than              $2e231
      just being able to call
      the tower…
1a:08 It's sad. The Emperor                   $2e1ee
      Draygon still hasn't given
      up his desire to conquer
      the world.
1a:09 Hi! Have you become a true              $2e253
      wise man yet?
1a:0a SIMEA! I'm looking out                  $2e278
      for you.
1a:0b Long time no see.                       $2e288
1a:0c How are you? How ya' been               $2e297
      doin'?
1a:0d Your rabbit is still on the             $2e2b3
      plain. Have you seen it?
1a:0e Let's play.                             $2e2dd
1a:0f Deo:"A long time ago, I was             $2e2ea
      one of Stom's favorites. I
      wish he would come back
      soon."
1a:10 Deo:"Oh Stom! Let's play!"              $2e32c
      SIMEA:"I'm sorry, I'm not
      Stom… He is gone…"▼
      Deo:"That's a lie! He
      couldn't be dead…… …  …"▼
      "Please take this… It
      reminds me of him…… ……
      Avenge his death for me!"
1a:11 Deo:"Avenge his death for               $2e3bf
