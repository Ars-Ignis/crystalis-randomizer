NOTE:
Speed [0:20] for sword shots:
  - 0 is very slow straight shot
  - 1..7 gradually speed up
  - 8 seems a lot faster than 7
  - 9 and 10 are faster still
  - 11 goes off quickly an an angle (either diagonal or right, depending)
  - 12 is slow for the same angle
  - 13-15 medium speed
  - 16 goes quickly upward, then turns forward at slow speed
  - 17-26 are just different speed combos
  - 27 goes up then diagonal
multiple shots can spawn at the same time - just uses the next spawn slot
