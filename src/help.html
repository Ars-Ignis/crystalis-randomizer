    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <div>
      <p>Welcome to Crystalis Randomizer.  This project seeks to
        provide fresh gameplay experiences through the class NES game
        Crystalis.

    <h1>Gameplay Changes</h1>
    <div>
      <p>A number of gameplay changes have been made to support randomization.
      <ul>
      <li>Items are shuffled throughout the game.  Items are split into five
        categories (key items (anything required for progression, like swords,
        orbs, bows, and fetch quest items), bonus items (unique items not
        required for progression, like the passive equipped items), consumables
        (non-unique items), magics, and traps (mimics).  Flags are provided to
        control exactly whether and how these categories are shuffled.
      <li>Adds a "difficulty level", which can be seen in the
        bottom-right corner next to the player's level.  Each key or
        bonus item that is picked up increases the difficulty level by 1, to a
        maximum of 47.
      <li>Enemies are shuffled throughout the game.
      <li>Enemy stats (attack, defense, HP, experience and gold
        rewards) are normalized based on the difficulty level.
      <li>A passage is (optionally) opened between Valley of Wind and Lime Tree.
      <li>A number of triggers have been slightly changed (see below).
      <li>A number of characters spawn in multiple locations independent of
        game events (e.g. Zebu remains in the cave the entire game, rather
        than "moving" to Shyron after calming the sea).
      <li>Some minor bug fixes: screen shaking is fixed, and vampire 2 no longer
        speeds up at the start of the fight.
      <li>Swan gate now has a pair of guards on the opposite side, to allow going
        through either direction (with Change).
      <li>It is now possible to teleport out of the tower, and to get
        back in via the pyramid back entrance.
      <li>Sword of Thunder always teleports to Shyron, no matter where it's found
        (though this can be disabled).  The warp checkpoint is immediately set,
        and in case there's no way back, Asina will teleport the player back to
        Mezame Shrine.
      </ul>

    <h1>Items</h1>
    <div>
      <ul>
      <li>Inventory sorting is disabled for swords and orbs/bracelets to prevent
        items from clobbering each other.
      <li>Orbs and bracelets are progressive upgrades: the first item you get,
        even if it says "bracelet" will give you the orb, and the second will
        give the bracelet.  The distinction is important only because Tornel is
        keyed off finding the chest that gives the tornado bracelet, rather than
        by finding both upgrades.
      <li>Orbs and bracelets may now (optionally) be automatically equipped.
        Just change swords and the powerup will change, too.
      <li>Sword damage has been renormalized.  Rather than depending on the
        element (normally, wind=1, fire=2, water=4, thunder=8), the sword power
        depends on the number of upgrades (no upgrades=2, ball only=4, bracelet=8).
      <li>Stab damage no longer doubles the sword base power, but is
        now always just 2.
      <li>The Power Ring is nerfed to double the sword base damage, rather than
        the level.
      <li>Armors and shields are nerfed to only provide half the defense value.
        Monster attack values are rescaled to match.
      <li>Powerful armors will only provide up to a maximum of LVL*2 defense.
      <li>Pendant of Deo is buffed to provide MP while moving.
      <li>Iron Necklace and Shield Ring are buffed to double the armor/shield
        value, rather than the level.
      <li>Medical Herb can be buffed to 2x or 3x the effectiveness.
      <li>Leather Boots are (optionally) replaced with Speed Boots.
      </ul>

    <h1>Triggers</h1>
    <div>
      <p>In the following, items in brackets refer to whatever item
        is shuffled into a slot, while unparenthesized items refer to the
        actual item.
      <ul>
      <li>Tornel teaching [Teleport] is blocked on finding exactly the
        Tornado Bracelet, regardless of whether the Ball of Wind has been
        found.
      <li>[Barrier] now (optionally) requires calming the sea, rather
        than just ghetto flight.
      <li>TODO - mesia, wise men, queen, etc...
      </ul>
