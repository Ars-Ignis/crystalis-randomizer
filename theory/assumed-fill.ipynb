For example,\n","\n","$$\n","R(l_1) = (k_1 \\land k_2 \\land k_4) \\lor (k_3 \\land k_5).\n","$$\n","\n","A requirement can be *satisfied* by a subset\n","$A = \\{k_{a_1}, \\ldots, k_{a_J}\\}$ of key items,\n","\n","$$\n","\\left.R(l_j)\\right|_A,\n","$$\n","\n","provided that there exists a disjunct\n","$(k_{b_1} \\land \\cdots \\land k_{b_K})$\n","with all $k_{b_i} \\in A$.\n","\n","Define a *filling* as a mapping $f: \\mathbb{Z}_N \\to \\mathbb{Z}_M$\n","such that the item $k_i$ is found in location $l_{f(i)}$.\n","\n","A filling $f$ is *solvable* if there exists a sequence\n","$k_{a_1}, \\ldots, k_{a_N}$, such that for all\n","$i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_N$, the requirement $R(l_{f(i)})$ is satisfied\n","by the subset $\\{k_{a_1}, \\ldots, k_{a_i}\\}$.\n","\n","\n","# Assumed fill\n","\n","Define a *partial filling* as a mapping $f_n$ from a subset of\n","$n < N$ key items to locations.  We say $k_i \\in f_n$ if\n","$f_n$ maps $k_i$ to a location.  A requirement $R(l_j)$ is satisfied\n","by a subset of items $K' \\subseteq K$ and a partial filling $f_n$ if\n","there exists an ordering\n","$k_{a_1}, \\ldots, k_{a_N'}$ of $K'' \\subseteq K - K'$ such that\n","for all $i$, $R(l_{f_n(k_{a_i})})$ is satisfied by\n","$K' \\cup \\{k_{a_1}, \\ldots, k_{a_{i-1}}\\}$.\n","\n","Now consider the following algorithm to generate a filling $f$ given\n","a set $K$ of key items and a set $L$ of locations with requirements\n","$R$.  We build up a sequence of partial fillings $f_1, \\ldots f_N$\n","as follows: for each $i$, choose a random item\n","$k_i \\in K_i$ where $K_i = K - \\{k_1, \\ldots, k_{i-1}\\}$.\n","This leaves a subset of locations\n","\n","$$\n","L_i = \\left\\{l \\in L : \\left.R(l)\\right|_{K_if_i}\\right\\}\n","$$\n","\n","that are reachable by all remaining key items under the partial\n","filling.  Choose a random location $l_i \\in L_i$ and set the\n","partial filling $f_i(k_i) = l_i$.  Repeat until all key items\n","are filled, aborting if any $L_i$ is empty.\n","\n","**Theorem 1**: If all items are successfully placed, then the result\n","is a solvable filling.\n","\n","**Lemma 2**: Under an assumed filling $f$, the requirement\n","$R(l_{f(i)})$ is satisfied by the set of items\n","$\\{k_{i+1}, \\ldots, k_N\\}$.\n","\n","**Proof**: Begin with the last placement, $i = N$, as a base case.\n","The item $k_N$ is placed at a location $l_{f(N)}$ that is reachable\n","under $f$ with no items.  Inductively, for any $i < N$, given that\n","all $i' > i$ are reachable, then by the placement rules, $i$ is\n","reachable, too.\n","\n","\n","# Multiple copies of single-use items\n","\n","The preceding logic becomes slightly more difficult if multiple\n","identical copies of the same item are available.  In particular,\n","suppose $k_1 = k_2$ are placed at $l_1$ and $l_2$, while $k_3$ and\n","$k_4$ are placed at $l_3$ and $l_4$, respectively, with\n","requirements $R(l_1) = \\emptyset$, $R(l_2) = k_3$, and\n","$R(l_3) = R(l_4) = k_1$.  If the player uses the $k_1$ from location\n","$l_1$ to open $l_4$ then item $k_3$ is now permanently locked.\n","\n","To explore this further, we make a distinction between two types\n","of blocks.  A location $l$ is *hard-blocked* by an item $k$ if\n","there is no possible way to open $l$ without $k$, regardless of\n","glitches.  A location $l$ is *logic-blocked* by an item $k$ if\n","there is no way to open $l$ without $k$ when restricted to the\n","randomizer's logic.  Because players will use \"off-logic\" glitches,\n","it is important to make this distinction and ensure that even\n","such off-logic glitches cannot possibly cause a soft-lock.\n","\n","Suppose again that we have two identical items $k_1 = k_2$,\n","placed at locations $l_1$ and $l_2$.  We make an artificial\n","distinction between $k_1$ and $k_2$ in the requirement lists\n","to differentiate between the effect of each usage, though\n","they can be interchanged freely.  Thus, suppose $l_3$ is blocked\n","on $k_1$ and $l_4$ is blocked on $k_2$ (Note: there could be more\n","than one location blocked, as well as partial/conditional blocks\n","where alternative items would suffice.  These make it much more\n","difficult to reason about.  If a confuguration is solvable,\n","we can further determine if it is impossible to soft-lock as\n","follows:\n","\n","1. Exchange the items so that $l_1$ holds $k_2$ and $l_2$\n","   holds $k_1$.\n","2. Traverse the graph \"in-logic\".\n","3. If the exchanged graph is solvable, then the configuration\n","   is provably safe from soft locks.\n","4. Otherwise, traverse the graph with all glitches enabled.\n","5. If the traversal completes, then it won't be a soft lock,\n","   though it might be very difficult to win.  This is an\n","   acceptable condition.\n","6. Otherwise, we need to prove that it's impossible to use\n","   the items in the wrong order.  Consider the set of locations\n","   $L*$ whose requirements include $k_1$ or $k_2$.  The seed is\n","   still safe as long as *all* elements of $L*$ remain locked\n","   after a full traversal.\n","\n","Note that this approach handles most cases, but it does mean that\n","if a player uses an off-logic glitch to unlock the location where\n","the first copy of the item is needed, then they may be required\n","to use another different glitch to acquire the second item.\n","\n","Note also that the full-glitch traversal is important, since\n","otherwise the last step only proves that a fully on-logic game\n","will not soft-lock.  Once the player departs from logic, they\n","lose that guarantee.\n","\n","If there are multiple different items with multiple copies, then\n","this blows up exponentially: we need to test each combination of\n","every such item.\n","\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
