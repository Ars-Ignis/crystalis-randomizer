# Changes

## 1.0.1
* Item shuffle is now done using "assumed fill".
* `Rf` (early flight) option has been removed since we can now bias
  the assumed fill algorithm to give flight at a random time.
* `Gp` (assume teleport skip) option has been added to allow the logic
  to require using flight to skip the teleport trigger at the entrance
  to Mt Sabre North.  This is included in the "advanced" preset.
* Opel statue no longer needs to be equipped to work.  Equipping it
  no longer blocks using quest items or stops storm attacks, though
  there's never a reason to do so.
* Linked to glitch explanation videos in help page.
* Fixed a few bugs:
    * Warp Boots disappearing or ending up in wrong row due to garbage
      data written into the ItemGetData table.
    * Portoa Queen's item (vanilla Flute of Lime) was being eaten but
      the previous bug masked it.
    * Ghetto flight logic forgot to guarantee Rabbit Boots.

## 1.0.0
* Initial release
