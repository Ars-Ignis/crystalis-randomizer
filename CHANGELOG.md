# Changes

## 1.0.1-rc1
* Item shuffle is now done using "assumed fill".
* `Rf` (early flight) option has been removed since we can now bias
  the assumed fill algorithm to give flight at a random time.
* `Gp` (assume teleport skip) option has been added to allow the logic
  to require using flight to skip the teleport trigger at the entrance
  to Mt Sabre North.  This is included in the "advanced" preset.
* Linked to glitch explanation videos in help page.

## 1.0.0
* Initial release
