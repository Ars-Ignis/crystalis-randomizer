 - obfuscate slots (random address, xors)
 - finish flags for flight statue skip

====

0. doesn't work in compiled mode? -> bad use of sink on getter
1. East cave mimic => shuffleMimics -> need to spread the iter
                                    -> standardmapedits 0x70 -> 0x7c
2. Randomize music broken
3. Apprentice money -> bad east cave interaction
4. Fog lamp & kirisa cave closed & desert -> didn't set 08 on effects
5. random goa entrances - missing exit/entrance pair!
    - mado 2 entrance missing one way -> bad rom patch for broken exits
6. iron wall at front of goa not staying dead -> forgot to mark
7. rage screen borked -> close caves messed it up, didn't replace it
8. shell flute not working -> entrance index matters
9. tiles below sabera elevator -> vanilla
10. fall past entrance in sabera palace -> normalized the exit
     (but it's complicated)
